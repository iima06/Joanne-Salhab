Sometimes one session is enough, sometimes several spaced sessions are necessary for lasting results. We will evaluate this together step by step.</p><h3>Can my baby benefit from a session?</h3><p>Yes, I treat newborns from their first days of life, gently and with adapted techniques. Examples: plagiocephaly, reflux, colic, torticollis, sucking or sleeping difficulties…</p><h3>Does osteopathy hurt?</h3><p>No. The osteopathy I practice is gentle and respectful of the body. If any technique could cause discomfort, I always inform you beforehand.</p><h3>Do I need a prescription to consult?</h3><p>No, osteopathy is a direct-access healthcare: you can consult without a medical prescription.</p><h3>Is osteopathy reimbursed?</h3><p>It is not reimbursed by the Social Security, but most health insurances partially or fully cover sessions. I provide an invoice at the end of the consultation.</p><h3>What is the difference between an osteopath and a physiotherapist?</h3><p>An osteopath works independently, without prescription, and with a global vision of the body. They use gentle manual techniques to restore balance and relieve tensions. A physiotherapist usually works under medical prescription, after an injury or surgery, with a rehabilitation program and exercises. Both approaches are complementary.</p></section>
